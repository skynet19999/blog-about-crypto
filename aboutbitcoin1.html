				<p>Bitcoin is limited to approximately 21 million units. In addition, the leading digital asset is more decentralized and more easily transferred to other participants than other forms of money, and is also resistant to censorship and corruption. With Bitcoin, it is possible to transfer value without permission and without the control of third parties.
                    Bitcoin's superior monetary properties come from a combination of cryptography, a decentralized network of nodes that use shared consensus rules, and a mining process that relies on energy. The currency itself creates economic incentives to allow the system to function, which also emphasizes trust in monetary properties.</p>
                <p>On average, new coins are released every ten minutes in a predictable manner until the 21 million limit is reached. This is a fundamental difference from the unpredictable changes in the monetary base in fiat monetary systems, in which inflation causes money to depreciate and creates various risky financial products, such as stocks, in which to invest.</p>
                <p>There is no company, organization or government behind Bitcoin. There is no product, no income stream, no dividends. It is not about making money, but about functioning as money and a store of value without any promises.
                    This function of money gives Bitcoin an advantage for many people - not only for risk-free savings, but also for financial inclusion. The basis of this benefit is limited supply, which ultimately also determines demand and therefore cost. For this reason, Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bitcoin is not a shady company that constantly recruits sellers who offer goods and receive money by recruiting new referrals. When demand for a product disappears, the system collapses - it's a pyramid. Bitcoin does not look for sellers. The asset has a limited supply, which is distributed among all participants, no matter how many there are. The value of the asset increases with the adoption of cryptocurrency. And adoption is increasing due to the monetary properties or benefits of Bitcoin and the increasingly noticeable scarcity of fiat money.</p>
                <p>The innovation or monetary properties of Bitcoin give the network quality and incentive to participate in it. Informing other people about this sovereign, non-manipulable form of money and encouraging them to participate does not automatically mean that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.</p>
